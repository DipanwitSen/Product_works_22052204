2. Install Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages using pip:

Bash

pip install flask werkzeug razorpay
3. Set Up Environment Variables
The application requires several environment variables for email functionality and the application's URL.

On Linux/macOS:

Bash

export EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"  # Use an App Password, not your regular password
export APP_URL="[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)"
On Windows:

Bash

set EMAIL_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
set EMAIL_PASS="your-app-password"
set APP_URL="[http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000)"
Note: The EMAIL_PASS must be an App Password generated from your Google account for security reasons.

4. Run the Application
Start the Flask application by running app.py:

Bash

python app.py
You should see output indicating that the development server is running. The application will be accessible at: http://127.0.0.1:5000

ü§ñ Chatbot & Knowledge Base
The chatbot is driven by a knowledge_base table in the SQLite database.

Adding New Q&A Pairs
The application's admin panel allows you to manage the chatbot's knowledge.

Access the Admin Panel: Log in as an administrator (create an admin user if one does not exist).

Navigate to answered_questions.html: This page provides a form to add a new Q&A pair with a dynamic SQL query.

Use Placeholders: For dynamic answers that retrieve data, use placeholders like PRODUCT_LIST, ORDER_STATUS, or STOCK_LEVELS in your answer.

SQL Query: For dynamic answers, provide the SQL query. Use ? as a placeholder for keywords from the user's question.
